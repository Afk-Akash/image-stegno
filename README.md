Steganography is a technique to hide a secret data in something that is not secret but data is secret that no one can except authorized person access that data...
This project is made using python only.
We can share hidden messages through media file using a technique that is known as steganography.
I used openCV python library for this project.
Authentic person can decrypt that encrypted media file.
we can also encrypt the message using a security key that will be more secure but i haven't used this.
